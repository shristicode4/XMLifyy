OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT
•We aim to develop a real-time hardware-based face 
recognition system for criminal identification that 
enhances accuracy and efficiency by integrating 
deep learning models with embedded systems. 
•The system will be designed for law enforcement 
applications, ensuring secure and reliable suspect 
identification.

Yolo v8 – face detection and counting
•Implemented YOLOv8 for real-time face detection.
•The system detects faces in images or live video 
streams and counts the total number of faces 
detected in a given frame..
•Optimized for fast and accurate face localization with 
an accuracy of 96.67%.
•Dataset used : Random Asian faces captured(2680)
